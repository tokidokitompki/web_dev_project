    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my very first website! My name is Taylor Tompkins.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and have lived in the surrounding metro Atlanta region since. So, Georgia is really all I have known! 
        I have relatives scattered all across the country though and have visited a lot of the states. </p>
    <h2>Experiences</h2>
    <p>I have attended 3 different schools: Gordon State College, West Georgia Technical College, and currently Kennesaw State University.
        I worked on an Associate's Degree in Biology at Gordon State College. I earned an Associate of Applied Science in Clinical Laboratory Technology from West Georgia Technical College.
        At Kennesaw State University, I am almost finished on earning a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
        I have experience in many fields but the bulk of my expertise lies in the clinical laboratory science realm. 
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My goals include transitioning to working in the LIS field of clinical laboratory science and buying a huge amount of land where I can design a custom house.</p>
