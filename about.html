    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my introduction! My name is Taylor Tompkins.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and have lived in the surrounding metro Atlanta region since. So, Georgia is really all I have known! 
        I have relatives scattered all across the country though and so have visited a lot of the states. 
        The farthest north I have traveled is to Canada and the farthest west is California.
        I like to think that I am a highly motivated, positive person that enjoys a lot of things: 
        I enjoy gardening and trying new recipes and cuisines. 
        I enjoy video games and K-dramas/J-dramas. 
        I adore kombucha and anything green tea related.</p>
    <h2>Experiences</h2>
    <p>I have attended 3 different schools: Gordon State College, West Georgia Technical College, and currently Kennesaw State University.
        I was a few credits short on an Associate's Degree in Biology at Gordon State College. 
        I earned an Associate of Applied Science in Clinical Laboratory Technology from West Georgia Technical College.
        Currently at Kennesaw State University, I am almost finished on earning a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
        I have experience in many fields (retail, service industry, call center) but the bulk of my expertise lies in the clinical laboratory science realm. 
        I truly love working in the lab - working as a team to deliver patient results to the doctors and nurses is very rewarding and there is never a dull moment. 
        
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>I have many goals as there are a lot of things I wish to do in my lifetime, but I do have main goals that I am diligently working on achieving:
        Earning/Saving up enough money to buy real estate and land to build a house.
        Transitioning my current career as a medical laboratory technician to working in the Laboratory Information Systems (LIS).
        Live and work in New Zealand for a few years. 
        Visit Japan and South Korea.
