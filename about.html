    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <img src="images/IMG_6457 (1).jpg">
    <h2>Welcome to the Introduction page! <br>My name is Taylor Tompkins.</h2>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <div id="paragraph1">
        I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and have lived in the surrounding metro Atlanta region since. So, Georgia is really all I have known! 
        <br>I have relatives scattered all across the country though and so have visited a lot of the states. 
        <br>The farthest north I have traveled is to Canada and the farthest west is California.
        <br>I work full-time at a hospital laboratory and I am a full-time online student. 
        <br>I like to think that I am a highly motivated, positive person that enjoys a lot of things: 
            <li>I enjoy gardening and trying new recipes and cuisines.</li> 
            <li>I enjoy nature and hiking through beautiful landscapes.</li>
            <li>I enjoy going to the beach and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I enjoy video games and K-dramas/J-dramas.</li>
            <li>I adore kombucha and anything green tea related </li>

    <h2>Experiences</h2>
    <div id="paragraph2">I have attended 3 different schools: Gordon State College, West Georgia Technical College, and currently Kennesaw State University.
        <br>I earned an Associate of Applied Science in Clinical Laboratory Technology from West Georgia Technical College.
        <br>Currently at Kennesaw State University, I am almost finished on earning a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
        <br>I have experience in a few different fields (retail, service industry, call center) but the bulk of my expertise lies in the clinical laboratory science realm. 
        <br>I hope to soon have experience in the tech field after graduation! 
        <br>I truly love working in the lab - working as a team to deliver patient results to the doctors and nurses is very rewarding and there is never a dull moment. 
        <br>I still would like to stay within the lab world after graduation which is why I would like to work in LIS - this way I am still helping the lab team 
        deliver patient results but behind the scenes instead. 
    </div>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <div id="paragraph3">I have many goals as there are a lot of things I wish to do in my lifetime! <br>I do, however, have main goals that I am diligently working on achieving:
        <br>Earning/Saving up enough money to buy real estate to rent out and for land to build a house.
        <br>Transitioning my current career as a medical laboratory technician to working in the Laboratory Information Systems (LIS).
        <br>Live and work in New Zealand for a few years with a visa. 
        <br>Visit Japan and South Korea to experience the food, culture, traditions and landmarks.
